# Jetbrains IDE Trial Reset

A simple utility that resets the trial period and remains your settings, configs untouched.

## Usage

Since ```2022.x``` it's not possible to reset only one specific IDE, so it resets them all.

After the script finished its work, you should go to your IDE, you might be logged in, but that's okay, just go log out and start new trial, and you're all good.

## Installation

Go to [releases](https://github.com/aquarell-dev/jetbrains-ide-trial-reset/releases) page and select the release according to your version of IDE.

You need to only download the executable, you don't need the source code at all.
